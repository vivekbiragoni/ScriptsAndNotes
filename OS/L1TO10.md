- **Multithreading OS:** Supports concurrent execution of multiple threads within a process.
- **Parallel OS:** Manages parallel processing architectures with multiple CPUs.

### Lecture 3: Multiprogramming, Multitasking, and Multiprocessing OS

**Multiprogramming:**
- Multiple programs in memory simultaneously to maximize CPU utilization.
- **Example:** Early IBM OS/360.

**Multitasking:**
- OS executes multiple tasks concurrently by rapidly switching between them.
- **Types:** Cooperative (voluntary yield) and preemptive (OS preemption).
- **Example:** Modern Windows, Linux, macOS.

**Multiprocessing:**
- Use of two or more CPUs to execute processes simultaneously.
- **Types:** Symmetric (SMP) and Asymmetric (AMP).
- **Example:** Unix-based systems, Windows Server editions.

### Lecture 4: Components of OS

**Kernel:**
- Core part managing system resources.
- **Functions:** Process management, memory management, file system management, device management, security.

**User Space:**
- Non-privileged area where user applications run.

**Shell:**
- Interface for user interaction with the OS.

**Types of Kernels:**
- **Monolithic Kernel:** All services run in kernel space.
- **Microkernel:** Minimal services in kernel space, others in user space.
- **Hybrid Kernel:** Combines features of both monolithic and microkernels.

**User-Kernel Communication:**
- **System Calls:** Mechanism for user space applications to request services from the kernel.
- **Interrupts:** Hardware or software interrupts for transitioning to kernel mode.
- **Traps and Exceptions:** Mechanisms for handling errors or specific conditions.

### Lecture 5: System Calls

**System Call Process:**
- User space application makes a system call, triggering a software interrupt to switch to kernel mode.

**Types of System Calls:**
- **Process Control:** `fork`, `exec`, `exit`, `wait`.
- **File Management:** `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`.
- **Device Management:** `ioctl`, `read`, `write`.
- **Information Maintenance:** `getpid`, `alarm`, `sleep`, `time`.
- **Communication Management:** `pipe`, `shmget`, `mmap`, `msgget`, `socket`.

**System Calls in Windows and UNIX:**
- **Windows Example:** `CreateProcess` for process creation.
- **UNIX Example:** `fork` for process creation.

### Lecture 6: Boot Process

**Steps:**
1. **Power On:** PSU activates, providing power to the system.
2. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization:** POST and hardware initialization.
3. **CPU Runs BIOS/UEFI:** Selects boot device and loads bootloader.
4. **Bootloader Execution:** Loads OS kernel into memory.
   - **Examples:** MBR, GRUB, BOOTMGR, boot.efi.

**Post-Bootloader Steps:**
- Kernel initialization, user space initialization, login prompt.

### Lecture 7: 32-Bit vs 64-Bit OS

**Differences:**
- **Registers:** 32-bit (8 registers), 64-bit (16 registers).
- **Memory Addresses:** 32-bit (4 billion), 64-bit (18.4 quintillion).
- **Physical Memory:** 32-bit (up to 4 GB), 64-bit (up to 16 exabytes).
- **Data Processing:** 32-bit (32 bits), 64-bit (64 bits).

**Advantages of 64-Bit OS:**
- Increased memory support
- Improved performance
- Enhanced security features
- Future-proofing
- Efficient handling of large files and datasets

### Lecture 8: Storage Device Basics

**Types of Memory:**
- **Primary Memory:**
  - **Registers:** Small, fast, volatile.
  - **Cache:** Intermediate storage, very fast, volatile.
  - **Main Memory (RAM):** Fast, large, volatile.
- **Secondary Memory:**
  - **HDDs:** Large, slow, non-volatile.
  - **SSDs:** Fast, expensive, non-volatile.
  - **Optical Discs:** Moderate capacity, slow, non-volatile.
  - **Flash Drives:** Portable, moderate capacity, non-volatile.
  - **External Hard Drives:** Large capacity, non-volatile.

**Comparison:**
- **Cost per GB:** Highest (Registers) to Lowest (HDD).
- **Access Speed:** Fastest (Registers) to Slowest (HDD).
- **Storage Size:** Smallest (Registers) to Largest (Secondary Memory).
- **Volatility:** Primary (volatile), Secondary (non-volatile).

### Lecture 9: Introduction to Process

**Program vs. Process:**
- **Program:** Static set of instructions.
- **Process:** Active instance of a program in execution.

**Process Creation:**
- Load program and static data into memory
- Allocate runtime resources
- Initialize PCB
- Set up I/O tasks
- OS hands off control to the main program

**Process Architecture:**
- **Text Segment:** Program code
- **Data Segment:** Global and static variables
- **Heap Segment:** Dynamic memory allocation
- **Stack Segment:** Function calls and local variables

**Attributes of Process (PCB):**
- PID, state, PC, CPU registers, memory management, I/O status, accounting

### Lecture 10: Process States and Queues

**Process States:**
- **New:** Process being created.
- **Running:** Process currently executing.
- **Waiting:** Process waiting for an event.
- **Ready:** Process ready to execute.
