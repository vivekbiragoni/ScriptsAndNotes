### Lecture 17: Conditional Variables and Semaphores for Thread Synchronization

### Conditional Variables

**Conditional Variable:**
- A conditional variable is a synchronization primitive that allows a thread to wait until a specific condition is met.
- It works in conjunction with a lock (mutex) to ensure proper synchronization.

**How It Works:**
1. **Thread Acquires a Lock:**
   - A thread can only enter the wait state if it has already acquired the associated lock.
2. **Thread Enters Wait State:**
   - The thread releases the lock and waits for the condition to be signaled by another thread.
3. **Thread is Notified:**
   - When the condition is met, another thread signals the waiting thread.
4. **Thread Re-acquires the Lock:**
   - The waiting thread re-acquires the lock immediately after being notified and starts executing.

**Why Use Conditional Variables?**
- **Avoid Busy Waiting:**
  - Conditional variables prevent threads from continuously checking for a condition (busy waiting), which wastes CPU resources.

### Semaphores

**Semaphores:**
- Semaphores are synchronization primitives used to control access to shared resources.

**Types of Semaphores:**
1. **Binary Semaphores:**
   - Also known as mutexes.
   - Can have only two values: 0 or 1.
   - Used to ensure mutual exclusion by allowing only one thread to access the critical section at a time.

2. **Counting Semaphores:**
   - Can have any non-negative integer value.
   - Used to manage access to a finite number of instances of a resource.
   - Allows multiple threads to enter the critical section concurrently, up to the count value.

**Semaphore Operations:**
- **wait (P operation):**
  - Decreases the semaphore value by 1.
  - If the semaphore value is less than 0, the thread is put into a waiting state.
- **signal (V operation):**
  - Increases the semaphore value by 1.
  - If there are waiting threads, one of them is restarted.

**Why Use Semaphores?**
- **Avoid Busy Waiting:**
  - Semaphores prevent busy waiting by putting the waiting thread into a sleep state and waking it up when the condition is met.
- **Manage Multiple Resources:**
  - Semaphores can manage access to multiple instances of a resource, unlike mutexes that only allow one thread at a time.

**Comparison with Mutex:**
- **Semaphore:**
  - Allows multiple threads to access multiple instances of a resource.
- **Mutex:**
  - Ensures mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to access a single shared resource at a time.

### How Conditional Variables and Semaphores Work Together

**Conditional Variable Usage:**
- Threads use conditional variables to wait for specific conditions while holding a lock.
- When the condition is not met, the thread releases the lock and waits.
- Another thread signals the condition variable when the condition is met, waking up the waiting thread, which then re-acquires the lock and proceeds.

**Semaphore Usage:**
- Semaphores manage access to resources and prevent busy waiting.
- A thread performing the `wait` operation will sleep if the resource is unavailable and wake up when the `signal` operation is performed by another thread.

**Handling Thread Synchronization:**
- Conditional variables and semaphores can be used together to efficiently synchronize threads and manage shared resources without busy waiting.

### Detailed Steps for Thread Synchronization Using Conditional Variables

1. **Thread A:**
   - Acquires the lock (mutex).
   - Checks the condition.
   - If the condition is not met, it releases the lock and waits on the conditional variable.

2. **Thread B:**
   - Acquires the lock (mutex).
   - Modifies the shared resource or condition.
   - Signals the conditional variable to wake up Thread A.
   - Releases the lock.

3. **Thread A:**
   - Wakes up when signaled.
   - Re-acquires the lock.
   - Checks the condition again and proceeds if met.

### Sample Code Using Conditional Variables (Pseudocode)

```c
// Shared resources
std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;

// Thread A
void threadA() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    while (!ready) {
        cv.wait(lock);
    }
    // Proceed when condition is met
}

// Thread B
void threadB() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    // Modify shared resource
    ready = true;
    cv.notify_one();
}
```

### Summary

**Conditional Variables:**
- Allow threads to wait for specific conditions while holding a lock.
- Prevent busy waiting by releasing the lock and putting the thread to sleep.

**Semaphores:**
- Manage access to shared resources using `wait` and `signal` operations.
- Binary semaphores (mutexes) for mutual exclusion.
- Counting semaphores for managing multiple instances of a resource.
- Avoid busy waiting by putting threads to sleep and waking them up when resources become available.

**Benefits:**
- Efficient resource management.
- Prevents busy waiting, saving CPU cycles.
- Ensures proper synchronization and avoids race conditions.

**Flowchart for Conditional Variable:**

```
Thread A:                        Thread B:
  - Acquire Lock                  - Acquire Lock
  - Check Condition               - Modify Condition
  - Wait on Condition Variable    - Signal Condition Variable
  - Release Lock                  - Release Lock
  - Wake up and Re-acquire Lock
  - Proceed
```
