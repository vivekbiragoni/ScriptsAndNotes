### Lecture 20: The Dining Philosophers Problem

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that illustrates the challenges of allocating shared resources without causing deadlock or starvation.

### Problem Description

**Setup:**
- Five philosophers sit around a circular table.
- Each philosopher alternates between two states: thinking and eating.
- There are five forks, one between each pair of philosophers.

**Behavior:**
- When a philosopher is thinking, they do not interact with the forks.
- When a philosopher is hungry, they attempt to pick up the two forks adjacent to them (left and right).
- A philosopher can only pick up one fork at a time.
- A philosopher can eat only when they have both forks.

### Potential Problem: Deadlock

**Deadlock Scenario:**
- If all five philosophers become hungry simultaneously and each picks up their left fork, all will be waiting for their right fork.
- This results in a deadlock where no philosopher can proceed.

### Solution Using Semaphores

**Semaphores:**
- Each fork is represented by a binary semaphore.
- `wait(fork[i])` is used to pick up fork `i`.
- `signal(fork[i])` is used to release fork `i`.

**Initial Semaphore Declaration:**
```c
Semaphore fork[5] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
```

**Basic Semaphore Solution (Prone to Deadlock):**
```c
void philosopher(int i) {
    while (true) {
        // Thinking
        wait(fork[i]);              // Pick up left fork
        wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]);      // Pick up right fork
        // Eating
        signal(fork[i]);            // Put down left fork
        signal(fork[(i+1) % 5]);    // Put down right fork
    }
}
```

### Deadlock-Free Solutions

To avoid deadlock, enhancements must be added to the basic semaphore solution.

**Solution 1: Allow at Most Four Philosophers to Eat Simultaneously**

**Semaphore to Limit Eating Philosophers:**
```c
Semaphore eaters = 4;  // At most 4 philosophers can eat at a time

void philosopher(int i) {
    while (true) {
        // Thinking
        wait(eaters);              // Request permission to eat
        wait(fork[i]);             // Pick up left fork
        wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]);     // Pick up right fork
        // Eating
        signal(fork[i]);           // Put down left fork
        signal(fork[(i+1) % 5]);   // Put down right fork
        signal(eaters);            // Release permission to eat
    }
}
```

**Solution 2: Pick Up Forks Only If Both Are Available**

**Conditional Fork Acquisition:**
```c
void philosopher(int i) {
    while (true) {
        // Thinking
        wait(mutex);               // Enter critical section
        if (fork[i] && fork[(i+1) % 5]) { // Check if both forks are available
            wait(fork[i]);         // Pick up left fork
            wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Pick up right fork
            signal(mutex);         // Exit critical section
            // Eating
            signal(fork[i]);       // Put down left fork
            signal(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Put down right fork
        } else {
            signal(mutex);         // Exit critical section
        }
    }
}
```

**Solution 3: Odd-Even Rule**

**Odd-Even Fork Picking Strategy:**
```c
void philosopher(int i) {
    while (true) {
        // Thinking
        if (i % 2 == 0) {          // Even philosophers pick up left fork first
            wait(fork[i]);         // Pick up left fork
            wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Pick up right fork
        } else {                   // Odd philosophers pick up right fork first
            wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Pick up right fork
            wait(fork[i]);         // Pick up left fork
        }
        // Eating
        signal(fork[i]);           // Put down left fork
        signal(fork[(i+1) % 5]);   // Put down right fork
    }
}
```

### Why Semaphores Alone Aren't Enough

While semaphores can help manage access to shared resources, they alone do not prevent deadlock or starvation. Additional rules or enhancements are necessary to ensure a deadlock-free solution.

### Summary

**Dining Philosophers Problem:**
- Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating.
- They need two forks to eat, but can pick up one at a time, leading to potential deadlocks.

**Semaphore-Based Solutions:**
- Basic semaphore solution can lead to deadlock.
- Enhanced solutions:
  - Limit the number of philosophers eating simultaneously.
  - Conditional fork acquisition.
  - Odd-Even fork picking strategy.

**Deadlock-Free Solutions:**
- **Semaphore Limiting:** Limits the number of philosophers who can eat at the same time.
- **Conditional Fork Acquisition:** Ensures a philosopher picks up both forks only if both are available.
- **Odd-Even Rule:** Alternates the order of picking forks for odd and even philosophers.

### Flowchart for Deadlock-Free Solution (Odd-Even Rule):

1. **Start Thinking**
2. **Check Philosopher ID:**
   - If **even**, pick up left fork first.
   - If **odd**, pick up right fork first.
3. **Pick Up Forks:**
   - Wait for fork availability and pick up both forks.
4. **Start Eating**
5. **Put Down Forks:**
   - Signal to release both forks.
6. **Repeat Cycle**
