### Lecture 15: Introduction to Concurrency

Concurrency is a key concept in operating systems that enables multiple processes or threads to be executed simultaneously, improving system efficiency and responsiveness.

### What is Concurrency?

**Concurrency:**
- Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time.
- In the context of an operating system, it allows multiple processes or threads to be in progress simultaneously, even if they are not actually executing at the same moment.
- Concurrency can be achieved through multi-tasking, multi-threading, and parallel processing.

### What is a Thread?

**Thread:**
- A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
- Threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process but execute independently.
- Multiple threads within the same process can perform different tasks simultaneously.

**Characteristics:**
- **Shared Resources:** Threads within the same process share code, data, and file descriptors.
- **Independent Execution:** Each thread has its own program counter, stack, and set of registers.
- **Lightweight:** Creating and managing threads is more efficient than processes because threads share resources.

### What is Thread Scheduling?

**Thread Scheduling:**
- The process by which the operating system decides which thread should be executed by the CPU at any given time.
- Thread scheduling ensures that all threads get a fair share of CPU time and resources.
- It can be based on priority, time quantum, or I/O availability.

### Threads and Context Switching

**Context Switching:**
- **Definition:** The process of saving the state of a currently running thread or process and restoring the state of the next thread or process to be executed.
- **Components:** Involves saving and loading CPU registers, program counter, and stack pointers.
- **Overhead:** Context switching is an overhead because it consumes CPU cycles without performing any useful work.

**Thread Context Switching:**
- **Time Quantum (TQ):** Threads are allocated a time quantum, and the scheduler switches context when the time quantum expires.
- **I/O-Based:** Threads waiting for I/O operations are switched out, and other ready threads are given CPU time.

### How Each Thread Gets Access to the CPU

**Access Mechanisms:**
1. **Preemptive Scheduling:**
   - The OS forcibly switches threads after a fixed time quantum or if a higher-priority thread becomes ready.
   - Ensures fair CPU time allocation.

2. **Cooperative Scheduling:**
   - Threads voluntarily yield control of the CPU, typically when they are waiting for I/O operations or when they complete their execution.
   - Requires well-behaved threads to ensure fair scheduling.

### Single CPU System and Multi-Threading

**Single CPU System:**
- In a single CPU system, multi-threading allows multiple threads to share CPU time, improving resource utilization.
- **Context Switching:** Rapid context switching creates an illusion of parallelism.
- **Benefit:** Even though only one thread executes at a time, multi-threading improves system responsiveness and efficiency by overlapping I/O operations with computation.

### Benefits of Multi-Threading

**1. Improved Responsiveness:**
- Multi-threading allows applications to remain responsive even during heavy computation by offloading tasks to separate threads.
- Example: A user interface remains responsive while performing background tasks.

**2. Resource Sharing:**
- Threads share resources like memory and file descriptors, reducing the overhead associated with context switching between processes.

**3. Efficient CPU Utilization:**
- By overlapping I/O-bound and CPU-bound threads, the CPU can be kept busy, reducing idle time.

**4. Scalability:**
- Multi-threading allows applications to scale with multi-core processors, where each thread can run on a separate core simultaneously.

**5. Simplified Design:**
- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable threads can simplify program design and maintenance.

### Summary

**Concurrency:**
- **Definition:** The ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

**Thread:**
- **Definition:** The smallest unit of execution within a process.
- **Characteristics:** Shared resources, independent execution, and lightweight.

**Thread Scheduling:**
- **Purpose:** To allocate CPU time to threads fairly and efficiently.

**Context Switching:**
- **Definition:** Saving and restoring the state of threads or processes.
- **Mechanisms:** Time quantum and I/O-based context switching.

**Single CPU System:**
- **Benefit:** Improved responsiveness and efficiency through rapid context switching.

**Benefits of Multi-Threading:**

- **Efficient CPU Utilization:** Overlaps I/O and computation.
- **Scalability:** Leverages multi-core processors.
- **Simplified Design:** Makes complex tasks more manageable.

**Flowchart of Thread Scheduling:**

```
Start -> Initialize Threads
      -> Allocate Time Quantum to Thread
      -> Execute Thread
      -> Check Time Quantum or I/O Status
      -> Context Switch if Needed
      -> Repeat Until All Threads are Complete
```
