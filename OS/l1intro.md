An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.

### Primary Functions of an Operating System:

1. **Process Management:**
    - The OS handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. It ensures that processes are efficiently executed by the CPU and manages the process lifecycle.

2. **Memory Management:**
    - The OS is responsible for managing the computer's memory. This includes the allocation and deallocation of memory space as needed by various programs, ensuring that each process has enough memory to execute, and managing the swapping between main memory and disk storage.

3. **File System Management:**
    - The OS manages files on various storage devices, providing mechanisms for file creation, deletion, reading, writing, and access permissions. It organizes files in directories for easy navigation and management.

4. **Device Management:**
    - The OS manages device communication via their respective drivers. It handles input/output operations, ensuring that devices such as printers, hard drives, and display screens function correctly and efficiently.

5. **Security and Protection:**
    - The OS ensures that unauthorized users do not access the system. It protects data and resources from malicious or accidental damage by enforcing security policies and mechanisms.

6. **User Interface:**
    - The OS provides a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to interact with the system and execute commands.

7. **Networking:**
    - The OS manages network connections, allowing computers to communicate with each other over local or wide-area networks. It handles data transmission protocols and network resource sharing.

8. **Error Detection and Handling:**
    - The OS detects and responds to errors in hardware and software. It ensures that the system operates smoothly by handling errors and providing debugging information.
