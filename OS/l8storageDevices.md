### Lecture 8: Storage Device Basics

Understanding the basics of storage devices involves differentiating between various types of memory and storage. These can be broadly categorized into primary memory and secondary memory, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

### Primary Memory

**Primary memory** refers to memory that is directly accessible by the CPU. It includes:

1. **Registers:**
   - **Description:** Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold temporary data and instructions.
   - **Characteristics:** Extremely fast, very small in size (typically 32 or 64 bits), and volatile.

2. **Cache:**
   - **Description:** Intermediate storage between the CPU and main memory. Cache stores frequently accessed data to speed up access times.
   - **Levels:** 
     - **L1 Cache:** Smallest and fastest, located within the CPU.
     - **L2 Cache:** Larger and slightly slower, may be within the CPU or on a separate chip.
     - **L3 Cache:** Even larger and slower, shared among multiple CPU cores.
   - **Characteristics:** Very fast, larger than registers but smaller than main memory, volatile.

3. **Main Memory (RAM):**
   - **Description:** The primary storage used by the computer to store data that is currently being processed.
   - **Types:**
     - **Dynamic RAM (DRAM):** Commonly used for main memory.
     - **Static RAM (SRAM):** Faster but more expensive, used for cache.
   - **Characteristics:** Fast, much larger than cache, volatile.

### Secondary Memory

**Secondary memory** refers to storage that is not directly accessed by the CPU but used for long-term data storage. It includes:

1. **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):**
   - **Description:** Mechanical storage devices that use spinning disks to read/write data.
   - **Characteristics:** Large storage capacity, relatively slow, non-volatile.

2. **Solid State Drives (SSDs):**
   - **Description:** Storage devices using flash memory to store data.
   - **Characteristics:** Faster than HDDs, more expensive per GB, non-volatile.

3. **Optical Discs:**
   - **Description:** CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs used for storage.
   - **Characteristics:** Moderate storage capacity, slower access speeds, non-volatile.

4. **Flash Drives:**
   - **Description:** Portable storage devices using flash memory.
   - **Characteristics:** Moderate to large storage capacity, faster than optical discs but slower than SSDs, non-volatile.

5. **External Hard Drives:**
   - **Description:** HDDs or SSDs housed in external enclosures for portability.
   - **Characteristics:** Large storage capacity, slower than internal storage, non-volatile.

### Comparison of Different Storage Types

| Feature                    | Registers          | Cache               | Main Memory (RAM)     | Secondary Memory (HDD, SSD)       |
|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Cost per GB**            | Highest            | Very High            | High                  | Lower (HDD), Higher (SSD)          |
| **Access Speed**           | Fastest            | Very Fast            | Fast                  | Slow (HDD), Fast (SSD)             |
| **Storage Size**           | Very Small         | Small                | Large                 | Very Large                         |
| **Volatility**             | Volatile           | Volatile             | Volatile              | Non-volatile                       |

### Detailed Comparison

1. **Registers:**
   - **Cost per GB:** Extremely high due to their high-speed nature.
   - **Access Speed:** Fastest, as they are located within the CPU.
   - **Storage Size:** Very small, typically in bits or bytes.
   - **Volatility:** Volatile, data is lost when power is off.

2. **Cache:**
   - **Cost per GB:** Very high, but less than registers.
   - **Access Speed:** Very fast, but slower than registers.
   - **Storage Size:** Small, typically measured in KB to MB.
   - **Volatility:** Volatile, data is lost when power is off.

3. **Main Memory (RAM):**
   - **Cost per GB:** High, but less than cache.
   - **Access Speed:** Fast, slower than cache.
   - **Storage Size:** Large, typically measured in GB.
   - **Volatility:** Volatile, data is lost when power is off.

4. **Secondary Memory (HDD, SSD):**
   - **Cost per GB:** Lower for HDDs, higher for SSDs.
   - **Access Speed:** Slow for HDDs, fast for SSDs but slower than RAM.
   - **Storage Size:** Very large, typically measured in TB.
   - **Volatility:** Non-volatile, data is retained when power is off.

### Volatility

- **Volatile Memory:**
  - Data is lost when the power is turned off.
  - Includes registers, cache, and RAM.

- **Non-Volatile Memory:**
  - Data is retained even when the power is turned off.
  - Includes HDDs, SSDs, optical discs, flash drives, and external hard drives.

### Summary

- **Primary Memory:** Fast, small, and volatile. Includes registers, cache, and RAM.
- **Secondary Memory:** Slower, larger, and non-volatile. Includes HDDs, SSDs, and other long-term storage devices.
- **Comparison:** Primary memory is more expensive and faster with smaller capacity, while secondary memory is cheaper, slower, and has larger capacity.
